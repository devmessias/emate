# eMaTe

eMaTe is a python package implemented in tensorflow which the main goal is provide useful methods capable of estimate spectral densities and trace functions of large sparse matrices. 


## Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM)

The Kernel Polynomial Method canÂ estimate the spectral density of large sparse Hermitan matrices with a computaional cost almost linear. This method combines three key ingredients, the Chebyscev expansion, the stochastic trace estimator and kernel smoothing.


## Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ)


>The problem of estimating the trace of matrix functions appears in applications ranging from machine learning and scientific computing, to computational biology.[2]
