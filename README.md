# eMaTe

eMaTe is a python package implemented in tensorflow which the main goal is provide useful methods capable of estimate spectral densities and trace functions of large sparse matrices. 


## Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM)

The Kernel Polynomial Method canÂ estimate the spectral density of large sparse Hermitan matrices with a computaional cost almost linear. This method combines three key ingredients, the Chebyscev expansion, the stochastic trace estimator and kernel smoothing.


### Example

```python
import igraph as ig
import numpy as np
from scipy import sparse

g = ig.Graph.Erdos_Renyi(3000, 3/3000)
W = np.array(g.get_adjacency().data, dtype=np.float64)
L_sparse = sparse.coo_matrix(L)
vals_laplacian = np.linalg.eigvals(L).real
```

```python
from emate.hermitian import pykpm
num_moments = 50
num_vecs = 100
extra_points = 10
ek_laplacian, rho_laplacian = pykpm(L_sparse, num_moments, num_vecs, extra_points)
```

## Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ)


>The problem of estimating the trace of matrix functions appears in applications ranging from machine learning and scientific computing, to computational biology.[2]
